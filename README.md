For many of the connectivity analysis routines, for example to calculate the shortest path length and k-core decomposition, we used the brain connectivitiy toolbox (BCT, Rubinov and Sporns (2010), Complex network measures of brain connectivity: Uses and interpretations, NeuroImage, 52:3, 1059-1069). The toolbox is included in this repository.

To use the code, change the path, datdir (place to store the data) and figdir (place to store pdf figure output) in MarijnMain. MarijnCaseCfg can be used to design experiments.
