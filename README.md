For many of the connectivity analysis routines, for example to calculate the shortest path length and k-core decomposition, we used the brain connectivitiy toolbox (BCT, Rubinov and Sporns (2010), Complex network measures of brain connectivity: Uses and interpretations, NeuroImage, 52:3, 1059-1069). The toolbox is included in this repository.
